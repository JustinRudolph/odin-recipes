        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>I cobbled this recipe together from a myriad of online recipes. I couldn't find a more veggie-friendly option, and had BBQ sauce in the fridge. This is a kiddo and grandkid-friendly recipe you can whip up for an in-a-pinch meal... or add it to your regular menu rotation and get those veggies in without a struggle!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup lentils</li>
            <li>2 onions, diced</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>3/4 cup bbq sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Place lentils in a small pot and cover with 2 cups hot water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until lentils are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add ground beef and green bell pepper; cook and stir until browned, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir drained lentils, ketchup, barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and minced garlic into the skillet. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors combine and mixture thickens to desired consistency, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
          </ol>
